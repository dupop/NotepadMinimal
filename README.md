![.NETpad hero image](/graphics/hero.jpg)

Notepad Minimal is a clone of legendary Microsoft Notepad made with mission to restore its original spirit of minimalism.


This project is a fork of ([@.NETpad project](https://github.com/thurrott/NotepadWF-CS)) created by Paul Thurrott ([@thurrott](https://www.twitter.com/thurrott)) with the help of Rafael Rivera ([@withinrafael](https://www.twitter.com/withinrafael)), several outside contributors, and, thanks to his books, Charles Petzold.
.NETpad project was most close to old-school Microsoft Notepad from the avilable GitHub projects, so it was selected as a development base for this project.
**Many thanks for Paul, Rafael and other contributors of .NETpad!
