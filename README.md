# Notepad Minimal - Bringing Notepad back to its roots!

**About**

Notepad Minimal is a remake of classic and legendary Microsoft Notepad made with mission to restore its original spirit of minimalism.

Most important benefit of minimalism of old-school Notepad was possibility to work without distractions coming from non-essential features. This provides a possibility to use it e.g. for quickly taking notes or for making draft plans.

**Progress**

High prio:
- Adding context menu strip - Done
- Disabling of menu items and context menu items - TBD
- Reimplementing delete button to work same as in Notepad - TBD
- Find and Replace dialogs to be aligned to the ones on original Notepad - TBD
- Changing autosave option to use a backup file and not to owerwrite the original one without confirmation - TBD
- Check if application currently cahnges encoding and/or line ending by mistake?

Low prio:
- Refactoring - extracting classes if possible to reduce size of Form1 class which holds the whole implementation - TBD
- Encoding and line ending style to be displayed in status bar and to be possible to change in Save dialog - TBD
- Internationalization features (right to left, Open IME, insert & view unicode char, Reconversion) - not in plan, feel free to fork project if you need them
- Send feedback menu item - TBD
- Find more appropriate icon for this project fork, or restyle the current one - TBD

**Credits**

This project is a fork of ([.NETpad project](https://github.com/thurrott/NotepadWF-CS)) created by Paul Thurrott ([@thurrott](https://www.twitter.com/thurrott)) with the help of Rafael Rivera ([@withinrafael](https://www.twitter.com/withinrafael)), several outside contributors, and, thanks to his books, Charles Petzold.
.NETpad project was most close to classic Microsoft Notepad from the avilable GitHub projects, so it was selected as a development base for this project.

**:heart: Many thanks for Paul, Rafael and other contributors of .NETpad for investing time to make emulation of most of standard Notepad features!**

**:heart: Many thanks for Microsoft for providing such a great and stable application.**

Remaning work will be done by ([@dupop](https://github.com/dupop)) - a huge fan of classic Microsoft Notepad.
